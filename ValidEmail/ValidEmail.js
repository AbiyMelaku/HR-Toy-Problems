/*
DO KNUMBERS FIRST

A new email service, gitgud.com, has started an email service
All the email addresses will be of the following form:

____________@gitgud.com

The underlined section will be a string containing capital or
lower case letters or a period i.e. '.'

However there can never be two consecutive periods, the period
cannot directly preceed the @ symbol, and the string cannot start
with a period. e.g:

urgud.@gitgud.com : INVALID
.imgud@gitgud.com : INVALID

we..gud@gitgud.com

The preceeding string must be at least 3 characters long

Produce an algorithm that will count the possible email addresses of length N
