/*
* Given N cents count the number of ways to create change using 
* pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters
*
* Examples:
*
* CoinCount(4) = 1 (4 pennies)
* CoinCount(5) = 2 (1 nickel or 5 pennies)
* CoinCount(12) = 13 (1 dime 3 pennies, 13 pennies, 1 nickel 8 pennies, 2 nickels 3 pennies)
*
* EXTRA CREDIT: Create a solution that runs in linear time
* recursive are generally some type of k^n where k is some integer
* generally the branching factor of the recursion tree
